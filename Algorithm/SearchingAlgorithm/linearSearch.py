Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4], x = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one test case with array as [1, 2, 3 4] and element to be searched as 3. Since 3 is present at index 2, the output is 2.

Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30, 4, 5], x = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: For array [10, 8, 30, 4, 5], the element to be searched is 5 and it is at index 4. So, the output is 4.

Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 30], x = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: The element to be searched is 6 and its not present, so we return -1.
